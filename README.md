# Autonomous Revisions of Stylistic Writing

In order to run the code, Python 3 must be installed with Pip3. 

## Module Dependencies

With pip3 installed, these items should be installable via command line by navigating to the project directory and running `pip3 install -r requirements.txt'. If there are any issues, they can be manually found and installed online.

Note: pip3 may be installed as `pip`

* Numpy: This is used for some math
* Nltk: This is the natural language toolkit used for all NLP in this assignment.

# Running

There are two runnable files; `cohesiveParagraph.py` and `tenses.py`.

There is a list of sample paragraphs located in `sampleList.txt`

`cohesiveParagraph.py` reads from `cohesiveText.txt` and `tenses.py` reads from `tenseText.txt`.

To run each, simply run `python3 <FILENAME>.py` in the terminal. Python 3 may be installed with the command `python` instead of `python3`. 

Note: When run the first time, the programs will download required corpus. Note the download location and delete later if you wish.
